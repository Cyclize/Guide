If you want to change your servers version \(server with plugins support\), or even install Vanilla for pure Vanilla experience, refer to [Java Edition](java-edition.md)

Tired of Vanilla Minecraft? No problem! You can even install [Forge](forge.md) on the FreeMC and play modded Minecraft. To find out how, refer to forge

Not playing Minecraft: Java Edition? We got you covered! You can even install [Minecraft: Pocket/Windows 10 \(Bedrock Edition\)](bedrock-edition.md) server.
